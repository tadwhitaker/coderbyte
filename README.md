My Coderbyte Javascript answers

These are solutions to the Javascript track at coderbyte.com. I would do each problem myself and then look at how others did it differently, in particular how they accomplished something with fewer lines of code. At the top of each file, I wrote a small summary explaining important concepts.

For those interested, I'd suggest looking at solutions posted by leaena. They're available here:

I'm planning to refactor these soon, but will leave my old code in place because it's helpful to see how things change.
